# Networking Terms Explained

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network spanning large geographical areas, connecting multiple local networks (e.g., the internet).

- **Router**: A device that directs data traffic between networks, determining the best path for data packets.

- **Firewall**: A security system that monitors and controls network traffic based on predefined rules.

- **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**: A unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network for identification and communication.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.

- **Gateway**: A device (often a router) that serves as an entry/exit point between different networks.

- **Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network, typically measured in bits per second (bps).

- **Latency**: The time delay between sending and receiving data over a network, often measured in milliseconds.

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A secure connection over the internet that encrypts data and masks your IP address.

- **MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)**: A unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface (e.g., 00:14:22:01:23:45).

- **Data Packets**: Small units of data transmitted over a network, containing source, destination, and payload information.

- **TCP/UDP**: Protocols for data transmission; TCP ensures reliable delivery, UDP prioritizes speed over reliability.

- **Port**: A virtual endpoint on a device for specific services or applications (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

- **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**: A company providing internet access to users or organizations.

- **Switch**: A device that connects devices within a single network, directing data to specific destinations using MAC addresses.
